## Description

Budget Tracker is a simple project created out of fun to send email reports on your personal finances. It collects data from GSheet hosted on your Google Drive. GSheet's template is [following](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19QmyL81UbqdCaX4Xi77h8M2GM_s9AWMgcfalyqxrAhA/edit?usp=drive_link).

## Environment setup

Make sure to add service_account.json file - standard json key file generated from IAM & Admin -> Service Accounts -> Keys. Also, to send emails, setup your smtp server and create email_credentials.json file with following structure:

```json
{
    "from": "",
    "to": [
        ""
    ],
    "host": "",
    "port": ,
    "smtpUser": "",
    "password": ""
}
```

In this case, poetry is used to install all Python libraries needed to execute the code. It is also required to have virtual environment creatd in the project dir:

`poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true `

To install all the dependencies, use standard:

`pip install poetry `

Finally, make sure to adjust values in config.json

Poetry has too many packages, some are needed for GCP version, others for AWS. Cleanup will be done in the future.

## AWS

AWS version of the solution is the main one. It is using Infrastructure as a Code in Terraform in adition to custom python scripts. Keep in mind service_account.json content is stored as a part of SM.

Vairables file is not added to Git, so you have to add it locally.

To refresh code of AWS Glue in case any of the code files is updated, use following tf command:

```
terraform apply \
-replace aws_s3_object.tf_budget_tracker_bucket_object_main \
-replace aws_s3_object.tf_budget_tracker_bucket_object_helper \
-replace aws_s3_object.tf_budget_tracker_bucket_object_config \
-replace aws_s3_object.tf_budget_tracker_bucket_object_email
```
